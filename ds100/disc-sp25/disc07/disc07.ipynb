    "* What is the definition of “fairness” in this context?\n",
    "* Which individual or group of people are considered when we evaluate fairness?\n",
    "* Are we talking about whether each situation above is fair to an individual home-\n",
    "owner, a subgroup of society, or the whole society?\n",
    "* At the level of the individual homeowner, any error can feel unfair: why am I be\n",
    "over-/under-taxed?\n",
    "* At the level of the society, is it fair to have a general over or underestimation that varies with the value of the home (a regressive or progressive tax scheme)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Other important things to note:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some may feel that both regressive and progressive are unfair; that any systematic\n",
    "errors should not depend at all on the value of the property\n",
    "* It is possible to have a tax scheme that is systematically fair tax (i.e., not regressive\n",
    "or progressive) but is still quite inaccurate and still generates errors for individual\n",
    "homeowners. However, a tax scheme that generates no errors for homeowners will\n",
    "also have no systematic unfairness.\n",
    "* Unfairness of the second type (scenarios C and D) is a form of statistical bias that\n",
    "varies as a function of y (the response variable).\n",
